Vim - the ubiquitous text editor
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.

Vim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better. Among its features are:

    persistent, multi-level undo tree
    extensive plugin system
    support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
    powerful search and replace
    integrates with many tools

  News 	 Vim 9.0.1176 is the current version 
new :defer command

[2022-09-10] Cleaning up after creating a file or directory can easily be forgotten. To make it easier the :defer command has been added. It works like it does in the Go language. Also, you can add a flag to writefile() and mkdir() to have them defer a delete() call. This is especially useful in tests, where temp files need to be cleaned up. Read about it in the help file.

Virtual text has been implemented

[2022-09-10] The past weeks a new feature has been added, that allows for displaying text in between the buffer text. Since this text does not exist in the file this is often called "virtual text". The virtual text can appear inside the line, after the line and below the line. You can read about it in the help. (Bram Moolenaar)
